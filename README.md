# Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI brain scans into **four categories**:

- **Glioma**  
- **Meningioma**  
- **Pituitary Tumor**  
- **No Tumor**  

The model is trained on a labeled MRI dataset and can predict the tumor type from a single MRI scan with high accuracy. A **Tkinter GUI interface** allows uploading images for real-time predictions.

## Technologies & Libraries
- **Python 3.10**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Tkinter** (for GUI interface)

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Resizes images, normalizes pixel values, and creates batches for efficient training.  
- **CNN Architecture:** Multi-layer CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.  
- **Training & Evaluation:** Tracks training and validation loss and accuracy.  
- **Visualization:** Loss and accuracy curves for performance monitoring.  
- **GUI Prediction Interface:**  
  - Upload an MRI image  
  - Display the predicted tumor type along with the image
